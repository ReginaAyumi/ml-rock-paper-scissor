## Rock Paper Scissor Detection with Machine Learning
### Project Criteria
- The dataset must be divided into train set and validation set.
- The size of the validation set must be 40% of the total dataset (training data has 1314 samples, and validation data has 874 samples).
- Must implement image augmentation.
- Using image data generator.
- The model must use a sequential model.
- Model training does not exceed 30 minutes.
- The program was carried out at Google Colaboratory.
- The accuracy of the model is at least 85%.
- Can predict images uploaded to Colab.

### Additional Criteria
- The accuracy of the model is above 85%
- Using more than 1 hidden layer.
- Implemented more image augmentation.
- Using optimizers and loss-functions that are not taught in class.
